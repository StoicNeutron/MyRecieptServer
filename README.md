<h1>My Receipt</h1>
<p>Hackathon's Prject. Location: George Mason University. <a href="https://www.hackfax.com/">HackFax</a> </p>

<p>My receipt is a project we came up to competed at the Hackathon. We won the 1st place on a <b>Start Up</b> track.</p>
<p>Interesting Fact: I always had this idea of creating an application where all your receipts are organize and manage within one place. Go paperless, no more massive amount of email and paper receipts within your email inbox.</p>
